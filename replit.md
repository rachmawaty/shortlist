# Shortlist - Job Tracker AI Agent

## Overview
Shortlist is a brutally honest AI-powered job tracker that helps job seekers manage, evaluate, and track job applications. It uses OpenAI to parse resumes and evaluate job descriptions against the candidate's profile.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + Shadcn UI + wouter routing
- **Backend**: Express.js + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL + multer (file uploads) + pdf-parse
- **AI**: OpenAI via Replit AI Integrations (gpt-5-mini for parsing/evaluation)
- **Auth**: Replit Auth (OIDC) - supports Google, GitHub, Apple, email/password

## Key Features
- PDF resume upload with drag-and-drop (parsed by AI)
- Job description evaluation with brutally honest hiring manager assessment
- Master tracking table with status management
- Follow-up alerts for applications > 14 days old
- Dark/light mode toggle
- User authentication (Google, GitHub, Apple, email/password)
- Per-user data isolation (userId on resumes and jobs)

## Data Models
- `users` - Auth users (managed by Replit Auth)
- `sessions` - Auth sessions (managed by Replit Auth)
- `resumes` - Stores parsed resume data per user (userId scoped)
- `jobs` - Stores job applications with AI evaluations per user (userId scoped)
